50 years old, male, no medical history. He had fever, phlegmatic cough, and sore throat for 4 days. 38.0Â°C, clear consciousness, BP 120/56, pulse 70/min, SpO2 97%. Positive for A by rapid influenza diagnostic kit. Chest auscultation was normal, and the pharynx was red and swollen. Chest x-ray showed no abnormal findings.
The diagnosis of influenza A was made. Since more than 72 hours had passed since the onset of the disease, we decided not to administer antiviral drugs, but to monitor the patient with symptomatic treatment using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics, antitussive expectorants, and other drugs.
