# MediCheck_Hackthon
This project aims to explore the intersection of medicine and technology, with a focus on optimizing the time spent by doctors on paperwork and enhancing communication with patients and medical staff.

## Problem Statement
Doctors spend a significant amount of time on paperwork and filling out medical records, leaving less time for direct patient care. We believe that this time is valuable and should be utilized efficiently to improve patient care and foster better communication among healthcare professionals.

## Solution Approach: Visual Check
Our approach centers around reducing paperwork and streamlining processes to make better use of doctors' time. We introduce a visual check system as an architectural solution.

## User Input
Patients sometimes exaggerate their symptoms to ensure they are taken seriously. While it's essential to address their concerns, it is also crucial to prioritize patients based on their medical needs. Our system helps doctors efficiently assess patients, ensuring that appropriate attention is given to each individual.

## Health History and Information Sharing
We have observed a lack of information sharing within and between medical facilities. To address this, we propose that patients maintain their health data. While ensuring data confidentiality and adhering to government regulations, we aim to solve encryption and high-security challenges for each person's information.

By standardizing health history information in the SOAP format (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan), we enable effective sharing of patient data. This standardized approach minimizes gaps in information transfer and differences in documentation styles among healthcare providers.

## Project Goals
Optimize doctors' time by reducing paperwork and administrative tasks.
Improve healthcare cost-effectiveness by reducing unnecessary hospital visits for minor patients.
Enhance communication and information sharing among medical professionals.
Ensure data security and confidentiality in handling sensitive patient information.
We believe that by leveraging technology, we can revolutionize the healthcare industry and enhance the overall patient experience.

Please note that this project is still in the early stages, and further development and collaboration are required to bring it to fruition.
