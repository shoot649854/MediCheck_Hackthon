This includes gathering information about the patient's medical history, current symptoms, lifestyle, and any other relevant factors. Once the patient's needs and goals are identified, the next step is to develop a treatment plan that is tailored to the individual patient. This plan should include a combination of therapies, medications, lifestyle changes, and other interventions that are designed to help the patient reach their goals.
